# Code generator to box of medicines


## Introduction  
This is a project that I thought to the final project of CS106A - Code in Place, a Computer Science Stanford course.
## 1. Problem  
Counterfeiters are a big problem in almost any area. But, in some areas, they can kill people. One of these areas is pharmaceutical industry.
Malaria is one of the most recurrent diseases in the world each year. According to World Health Organization (WHO) 2019 Malaria Report, the estimation of malaria cases from 2010 to 2018 in the world are around 2.072 billion cases. According to this report, the estimation of malaria mortality rate in this time range is around of 0.20%, resulting on 4.263 million deaths (approx.).

The African continent is the most affected continent by this disease. From 2010 to 2018, 1.871 billion cases were estimated in African continent, resulting in 90.3% of world cases (Table 1).

Table 2 shows that the mortality rate was around 0.21%, resulting an estimation around 3.93 million deaths by malaria in African continent (92.2% of world deaths by malaria).

Counterfeiters are one of the villains of these deaths. They make sugar pills (or pills with worst stuff) and insert it on drugstores, which increases the malaria mortality rate in African continent. If you don't think that it is a big deal, imagine that the bigger mortality rate in African continent can be because of this fake malaria pills!  

## 2. Solution
A Ghanaian programmer called Bright Simons thought about a solution to this problem: he thought that all medicine boxes of malaria medicine could have a different code with a sequence of numbers. When a customer buys this medicine, he/she could send this code to an SMS number or this code could be inserted at a QR code and a QR code app in a smartphone could read it and send it to compare. The costumer would receive a text message telling if the medicine is the real deal or not. Isn't it a good way to solve this problem?

## 3. My solution
I believe that I can complicate a bit more to counterfeiters. I'll try to make a code with numbers and letters to make it more difficult to smugglers to counterfeit those medicines.  

### 3.1. The code generator

A code with numbers and letters are probabilistically harder to be cracked or copied. With that in mind, I thought that I could create a code generator with 12 characters (same number of characters that Bright Simons has used). The code would start with an uppercase letter, and should be followed by 10 random numbers, and should be completed with a lowercase letter.

My code generator consists in five programs that completes each other:
* The first program that I wrote generates random uppercase letters.
* The second program generates random lowercase letters.
* The third program generates random numbers.
* The fourth program generates a random code with an uppercase letter, ten numbers and a lowercase letter.
* Finally, the fifth program is the application, consisting in a user interface with a button to generate the code, a button to exit the program and a label to show the code to the user.

I thought to create an image to be a background image to my user interface. So my girlfriend made a beautiful sketch for me. All images that I used are in "images" folder. I wrote three programs to create a background image:
* The first program sketched the drawing that she made.
* The second program blended the sketch from the first program with a sketch of “hope” word that I found on internet.
* Finally, I have created a filter (third program) to apply in the resultant image from the second program, creating my background image.

Illustration 2 shows the result of my final project.

Illustration 2 - Window application

The window have the background image that I created in Python and have three widgets:
* A button to generate the code.
* A label to show the code to the user.
* A button to close the program.

Illustration 3 shows the code generated when the button was clicked.

### 3.2. Technical information  

The program that generates the code imports the three programs described on item 3.1. It has only one function. This function has an empty string that will be updated three times: firstly when the ''uppercase letter'' program is run; secondly, a for loop is executed 10 times and the integer numbers generated by the execution of the program that makes random numbers are added to the string; finally, the string is updated when the ''lowercase letter'' program is run.  

The main program is the program that creates the application window. The ''code generator'' program was imported to this application. The main window has three widgets:
* A button on the top of the application window that trigger the a function and generates a code with an uppercase letters, ten numbers and a lowercase letters. This button has a command that activates a function which in turn activates the ''code generator'' function and updates the text of the label.
* A label in the center of the screen that begins with the text "Your code here" and is updated when the user clicks on the ''Generate code'' button.
* A button to close the application when it is clicked.

Following, I'll show the video that I made to illustrate how the program works.

## 4. Conclusion

As you can see in my video, the application is working fine. Although this is a simple project, it was required a hard work especially because of the image treatment and because of the logic to write a function to catch what is generated when the button is pressed and get this result to place in a label. On the final result I thought "it is a simple code to place the result in a label", but I almost forgot the hours of study to make it easier.

Finally, thank you Code in Place CS106A for this remarkable experience. With tears in my eyes I'm saying goodbye, hoping to see you guys in the future one more time. If that doesn't happen anymore, know that you guys will always have someone, even in anonymity, wanting your good. We had created an awesome community here. Thanks Chris, Mehron, Brahm, section leaders and to all students. See ya!

## Observations
1) I'm a Brazilian guy. So, I'm not an English native speaker/writer. If you see something wrong with my text or with my speak, please tell me and teach me. This will help to improve my English.
2) This is a very simple application. I was not worried about number recursion, line of number generation, Code Theory and criptografy. Maybe someday I'll try to improve this generator...
